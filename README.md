**Furniture Sales Forecasting**

Overview:

The process of forecasting furniture sales for the upcoming year using various time-series forecasting models, including Simple Exponential Smoothing, Holt-Winters, ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average), and SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA). The historical data for furniture sales will be leveraged to build and validate these models.

Dataset Information:

The Furniture Sales dataset contains historical information about furniture sales, including features such as product type, sales date, quantity sold, and other relevant metrics. The goal is to develop accurate sales forecasts for the next year.

Forecasting Models:

1. Simple Exponential Smoothing

2. Holt-Winters

3. ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)

4. SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA)

Implementation:

The forecasting models will be implemented using Python and relevant libraries such as pandas, statsmodels, and pmdarima. The code will be organized into separate scripts or notebooks for each model to ensure clarity and reproducibility.

Conclusion:

An overview of the Furniture Sales Forecasting project, detailing the forecasting models to be used, and the steps involved in implementing each model. For detailed information, users can refer to the accompanying code files.

Important: Regularly update and retrain the forecasting models with new sales data to enhance accuracy and reliability in predicting future sales.
